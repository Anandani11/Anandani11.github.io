<h1> A description of your own strengths and limitations </h1>

<p> I am a vibrant and positive person, I am able to adapt to any situation with ease, 
I can work well within a team and also on my own. My personality is my biggest strength, 
I am always ready to learn new things and here to help others in need. I am responsible, disciplined and very creative. 
My mind is my greatest friend but also my only limitation, sometimes I can entertain the confusion on things.</p>
