<h1> Core Identites and Values </h1>

<H2>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, 
    the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took. </H2>

<P> Through work I have managed to help others come to work as their whole self so they are able to focus on work and enjoy themselves. I am compassionate, a good listener and am able to see situations above the line. I started up a Facebook page and have done other things online to spread the love and motivation. I would love to be able to carry this on.
    I have been recognized by collegues with my efforts and have had collegues message me letting me know that they are grateful. Example texts messages with gratitude and nominations for prezzy cards through work.  Coding is my purpose, Love is my passion and Creativity is my outlet " 

<h2> Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h2>

<p> To learn the true purpose in life you must surrender and unlearn everything you have learnt consciously and unconsciously. We are a product of our past and surroundings, we have picked up on traits and thoughts from the womb. From a young age I have been a strong believer in positive thoughts and knowing that life is more then what was to the eye.  I have learnt that a big thing in life is your emotions. This can determine your quality of life. I am a strong believer on being happy and not letting yourself get down.  I have realized being nice is not the right thing, it is being genuine and able to communicate with compassion and truth.  
    My culture has allowed me to explore this, but before being able to genuinely explore I had to surrender everything I had learnt. </p>

    
<h2>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development </h2>
<p>My strengths is my willingness to learn and explore new things, self motivation and being realistic about life.
My limitations can be my own mind " your mind can be your best friend or your worst enemy ". </p>
    
    
 <h2>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h2>
 <p>With learning what will pull me through is my motivation to learn new things and my above the line thinking</p>  
 
 
 <h2>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h2>
<p>An example would be through work. We are recently going through Agile changes and one of the things that we had introduced is an " Accreditation Process " this here determined our KPI's and pay groups. We are to be performing in a "bronze level" minimum. During the final stages of this some team members had not reached the minimum level required. ( They now have a few more months to get to where needed ). I was fortunate to be the highest performer and due to this was asked to share my experiences and help others meet their targets. This was really fun and I was able to create so many special bonds with other people. I was able to help and push them through to the finish line. While most of the time things were good, there was a bit of resistance and tension here was dealing with other people that were negative and not happy with me as I was performing and they weren't. So naturally this caused one or two people to react differently to my help. The aim here was to persist and carry on helping as genuinely as you can without letting other peoples energy effect you. To be able to show compassion and work through things. Show them that you understand what they are going through and that you have also been through similar experiences but it is how we react to the situation that changes our outcome. Reflecting upon this I would have done things to keep myself protected a bit more in terms of my thoughts after work however at the end the outcome for everyone was postive, while some thank you and some don't, life is not about being recognised, it is about doing good things with out any expectations.
