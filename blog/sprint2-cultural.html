        * A description of your own strengths and limitations *

        I am a vibrant and positive person, I am able to adapt to any situation with ease, I can work well within a team and also on my own. My personality is my biggest strength, I am always ready to learn new things and here to help others in need. I am responsible, disciplined and very creative. My mind is my greatest friend but also my only limitation, sometimes I can entertain the confusion on things.
        
        * Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.*
        I will make a plan at the start of every week in my weekly spreadsheet on what I am going to do and when.
        I will use a timer to manage the time spent on each segment and stick to these guidelines.
        On every Sprint I will apply the below process:
        
        Process
        1. Get intentional and habitual
        2. Start your timer
        3. Understand: Get clear on what is being asked.
        4. Plan: Plan your approach
        5. Divide: Break into small steps
        6. Make an attempt at solving it (write Initial Solution) 7. Get unstuck
        8. Improve your solution (Refactor)
        9. Learn what you learned (Reflect)
        10. Practice
        I will also do my best to stay ahead coming into each Sprint.
       
        * A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.*

        When I am stuck, I am going to be proactive and I will use my facilitator and use Slack to speak to within our team. I will also make sure that I have understood the question and will try problem solving myself however I will use Slack to guide me through as well.
        
        * A description of what you expect from the facilitation team*
        
        Feedback Help
        Be yourself
        
        * Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.
        
        Only commitment is Dev A, everything else works around this unless there is an emergency.
