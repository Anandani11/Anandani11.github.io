<h2>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h2>

    <h3>Got blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
    This one here is hard as at first you get blocked on everything untill you actually really try and give it a go. For me having a break in-between my foundations course coming back to Sprint-4 this week I was originally blocked with creating my blogs again, 
    it all looked so hard on the first glimpse and trying to remember my flow was hard. Everything became clear to me when I looked back at my previous Sprint blogs and read my code. This then reminded me what to do again. 

    <h3>Solved a problem in an elegant way:</h3> Paying full attention to the task at hand and going back to look at what I have done previously to remind me of what I am doing or what I need to do. 
    
<h2>In both cases:</h2>

    What was the problem? Feeling stuck or lost. Not knowing where to start. 
    What problem solving techniques did you use? Rubber ducky method, trying something, Google. 
    How did you feel throughout the process? Good after I got into my flow. 
    What did you learn? Take your time, play around and try things. Talk out loud and use resources to guide you.
    
<h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h2> At first reading the problem solving methods looks easy but it is actually applying these methods to the task at hand is where you are tested. Keep going, do not stop, if you do not get this now you will soon. 

        
    Pseudocode
    Trying something
    Rubber ducky method
    Reading error messages
    Console.logging
    Googling
    Asking your peers for help
    Asking coaches for help
    Improving your process with reflection
